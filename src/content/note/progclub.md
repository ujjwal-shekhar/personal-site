Was the **Programming Club Administrator** at IIIT Hyd for 2-3 years.  
Cool highlights:

- Organized **CodeCraft** with 25k+ registrations worldwide, [read the problems here!](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/128597). Also prepping problems for the next codecraft `;)`
- Took a live graph theory session for 100+ offline students. [Read my slides!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQGKoIVHnKrJ-GxZYqNRzjrZ4BqL0XyHjciNNgjluFQ/edit)
- Ran **Lockout** events with 60+ participants (Python bot infra).  
- Reorg'ed the club, introduced a Design and Logistics team (best decision ever).
