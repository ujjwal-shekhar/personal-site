As part of **GSoC 2024**, I worked with UCSC’s Micro Architecture Lab under Prof. Jose Renau and Sakshi Garg. [Read the blog!!](https://gist.github.com/ujjwal-shekhar/46f872ca5b194a014cc6f16b0825261a)

Built a templated AST in C++ for hardware compilers and benchmarked with Google Bench. Some cases saw **up to 2× faster compile times** for $\approx$ 10M size of AST (loosely, lines of code).
